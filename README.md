Advanced Programming
====================
University of Colorado, Denver CSCI 3320
----------------------------------------

This is a collection of my assignments for advanced programming. 
Unfortunately our professor has fallen ill, and we now have a replacement.
Hopefully this will have minimal effect on the quality of the education and
of the assignments.

Assignment 1 (pa1)
------------------
Use the secant method and Newton’s method to find the root(s) of non-linear 
equations.

Solve with Newton: e^x – 1.5 –tan^-1(x)
Solve with secant: x^3 – sinh(x) + 4x^2 + 6x + 9

Assignment 2 (pa2)
------------------
Given a graph, G=(V,E) where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, 
find the shortest path between two vertices using an adjacency matrix and the
properties of matrix powers.

Assignment 3 (pa3)
------------------
Create two integer linked lists using the template-enabled class list in the list.h header
file. The first linked list will contain the squares of the first 10 integers in order, starting 
with 1. The second linked list will contain the values 2 and 4, in order. Concatenate the 
second list onto the end of the first list, using the overloaded += operator from the class.
Next, the resulting combined list will be modified. And finally, the program output will 
be various statistics and displays of the combined list, as described below.
